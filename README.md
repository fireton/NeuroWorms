# NeuroWorms

This repository represents my experiment with neural networks, implemented in C#. The project focuses on simulating worms, similar to the 'snake' game, evolving their brains through a genetic algorithm and natural selection.

## Introduction

NeuroWorms is a C# project aimed at exploring the capabilities of neural networks in the context of simulating artificial life. The primary concept revolves around evolving the intelligence of virtual worms in a snake-like game using genetic algorithms and natural selection. These worms start with primitive brains and develop their neural networks over time, eventually becoming more efficient at the game.

## Features

Here are some of the key features of NeuroWorms:

- **Neural Network Evolution:** The core of this project is the evolution of neural networks. Worms are controlled by neural networks that are subjected to genetic algorithms, mimicking the principles of natural selection.

- **Snake Game Simulation:** The worms' environment is reminiscent of the classic snake game. As they evolve, they get better at navigating and surviving within this game.

- **Learning and Adaptation:** Over generations, the worms' brains adapt and improve. You can observe how their behavior becomes increasingly sophisticated as they learn from their experiences.

## Getting Started

To get started with NeuroWorms, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuroWorms.git
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio:**
   - Open the `NeuroWorms.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.

You're now ready to explore and run the project in Visual Studio. This will allow you to work with the code, make modifications, and run the simulation to observe the evolution of worms' neural networks.
